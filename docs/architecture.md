# Architecture

## Boundary

AI News Navigator V2 begins with a modular monolith. The public product, database, source connectors, ingestion jobs, and intelligence modules share one repository while keeping explicit package boundaries.

The first milestone does not introduce queues or microservices. Those are deployment choices that can be added after source volume or processing latency proves they are needed.

## Core domain

### Source

A configured origin and connector. Source health is a first-class product concern.

The system records successful and failed runs, item counts, fetch frequency, reliability, copyright policy, and whether the source is first-party.

### Item

One original article, paper, release, product page, or post.

An item preserves five distinct concepts:

- Original URL and canonical URL
- Original publication time
- Discovery time
- Fetch time
- Processing time

`source_published_at` must never be overwritten with crawl time.

### Story

One real-world event supported by one or more items. Exact URL deduplication happens before semantic story clustering.

A story stores scores and a factual summary, while model-generated product analysis is versioned separately in `story_analyses`.

### Topic

A stable navigation concept such as a company, model, person, technology, or content type. Topic assignments include confidence and provenance.

## Ingestion contract

```text
SourceAdapter.fetch()
  -> RawSourceItem[]
  -> normalizeItem()
  -> canonical URL + hashes
  -> batch exact deduplication
  -> IngestionRepository.upsertItem()
  -> source run result
```

The ingestion package depends on interfaces rather than a concrete database implementation. This keeps source adapters and pipeline behavior testable without PostgreSQL.

The `jobs` workspace supplies the PostgreSQL implementation. Completing a source run updates both immutable run metrics and the source's current health. Exact conflicts on canonical URL or source external ID are counted as duplicates.

Scheduling is also owned by `jobs`. It derives due time from the latest completed attempt, applies bounded exponential backoff after failures, and takes an expiring PostgreSQL lease before network work begins. Hosted cron remains a deployment concern and only needs to invoke the due-source command.

## Intelligence boundary

Facts and interpretation remain separate:

- Items retain original source content and metadata.
- Stories retain the current factual synthesis and ranking signals.
- Story analyses retain model, provider, prompt version, evidence item IDs, confidence, product impact, and open questions.

The scheduled refresh generates the analysis layer through Vercel AI Gateway
after ingestion and deterministic Story processing. English source records stay
as the immutable evidence index, while Chinese display titles and interpretation
are stored separately for reader-facing presentation.

No LLM provider is referenced by the domain model.

The first processing stage is deterministic. Versioned item assessments score AI centrality and product impact before relevant items enter conservative Story clustering. Cluster assignments retain their algorithm version, similarity, and reasons so later embedding-based versions can be compared rather than silently replacing history.

## Next architecture steps

1. Monitor hosted PostgreSQL, cron, and AI Gateway usage on the current runtime.
2. Add alert thresholds and a small operational health view.
3. Evaluate the deterministic relevance and clustering baseline against a labeled fixture set.
4. Add embedding-assisted candidate retrieval and a merge/split review queue.
5. Add more official sources only when their provenance and content policy are explicit.
